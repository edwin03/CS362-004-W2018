Bug 1:

Software Under Test: Alvins Le's Dominion 
Platform: Linux

Description: Card only allows two actions instead of adding the number of actions.

Card Affected: Village
Village Description: +1 Card, +2 Actions

Summary:
This bug was found when I executed my "cardtest2.c" file on top of Alvin Le refactored "dominion.c" code. I noticed that it always returned 2 for the actions counter instead of adding two the number of the actions. 

Here is the snippet where of my "cardtest2.c" test output:

Test Result for Player 1
	PASSED: Player hand count
	PASSED: Player deck count
	PASSED: player played card count. 
	FAILED: Player action count expected 3, got 2 <--- returned 2 actions instead of 3
	PASSED: Opponent deck count.
	PASSED: Coin count.

	Test Result for Player 2
	PASSED: Player hand count
	FAILED: Player deck count expected 9, got 10
	FAILED: player played card count expected 1, got 2
	FAILED: Player action count expected 3, got 2 <--- returned 2 actions instead of 3
	FAILED: Opponent deck count expected 4, got 3
	PASSED: Coin count.

I think that the bug could be related to using the incorrect math operator. After looking at the source code inside the "Village_effect" function I see that the assignment "=" operator was used instead of the adding "+" operator.

	void village_effect(struct gameState *state, int handPos)
	{
		int currentPlayer = whoseTurn(state);

		//+1 Card
		drawCard(currentPlayer, state);

		//+2 Actions
		state->numActions = 2; //<----We can see here that "=" was used instead of "+" 

		//discard played card from hand
		discardCard(handPos, currentPlayer, state, 0);
	}

Bug 2:

Software Under Test: Alvins Le's Dominion 
Platform: Linux

Description: Only two cards are being drawn instead of three cards.

Card Affected: Smithy
Smithy Description: +3 Cards

Summary:
This bug was found when I executed my "cardtest4.c" file on top of Alvin Le refactored "dominion.c" code. I noticed that it always returned 1 less than the expected number of cards in the players hand. So Iâ€™m thinking that the "drawCard()" function is only being called twice rather than 3 times. 

Here is the snippet where of my "cardtest4.c" test output:

	Test Result for Player 1
	FAILED: Player hand count expected 7, got 6 //<---- hand count should be 7 after drawing 3
	FAILED: Player deck count expected 2, got 3
	PASSED: Player played card count.
	PASSED: Opponent deck count.
	PASSED: Coin count.

Here is a snippet of Alvin's "smithy_effect()" function:

	void smithy_effect(struct gameState *state, int handPos)
	{
		int currentPlayer = whoseTurn(state);

		//+3 Cards
		int i;
		for (i = 1; i < 3; i++) //<----the "drawCard()" function is called twice since 
		{
			drawCard(currentPlayer, state);
		}

		//discard card from hand
		discardCard(handPos, currentPlayer, state, 0);
	}
